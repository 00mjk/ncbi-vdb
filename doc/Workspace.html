    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <div class="section">

      <p>
		<strong>Workspace</strong> will implement a user-space file-system to
		provide transparent read-only access to remote or cached objects, in
		addition to a local read/write workspace volume.
      </p>

	  <p>
		Users <em>enter</em> a workspace by launching this tool, and by so doing
		gain access to NCBI remote resources as if locally mounted in their file
		system.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		Entering a <strong>protected</strong> workspace, i.e. a
		<strong>dbGaP</strong> project, will create a mount where all remote and
		cached <em>dbGaP</em> objects will appear as fully decrypted objects,
		allowing them to be accessed by standard tools. In addition, their
		workspace volume will be encrypted.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		After exiting a workspace, the user-space mounts will disappear, leaving
		only the actual OS file-system. All files within protected workspaces
		will  remain encrypted, including the read/write
		<strong>workspace-volume</strong>.

    <!-- Purpose -->

    <a name="purpose">

    <h2>Purpose</h2>

    <div class="section">

	  <p>
		This utility addresses the need to provide unencumbered access to
		protected data while keeping the data reasonably well protected. It does
		not provide iron-clad protection, particularly in that it does not
		prevent the user from violating data confidentiality; but it does allow
		the user to preserve it.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		The principal technique employed is the use of VDB
		<strong>on-the-fly</strong> decryption in response to requests for
		data. The tool runs as a process in Linux, MacOS or Windows, and acts as
		a bridge between the host kernel and VDB libraries. Once situated there,
		it can also provide additional services.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		By utilizing networking connections with NCBI, the tool can also provide
		a <q>mount</q> of objects that are remotely stored on NCBI's
		servers. These include public as well as
		<strong>authorized-access</strong> objects. Working with the VDB
		<strong>KeyRing</strong> service, access authorization can be utilized
		to this end.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		To assist users in working with confidential data while not compromising
		its confidentiality, we provide a means of creating a
		<strong>workspace-volume</strong>. This is nothing more than a normal
		file within the host file-system that is <q>mounted</q> under the
		workspace such that all writes to the file are encrypted and all reads
		from it are decrypted. The file itself will contain a portable VDB
		filesystem, the contents of which will be visible only after entering a
		workspace.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		Going forward, we intend to provide custom mounts that represent the
		result of queries to NCBI's resources as tangible objects.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
		Similar in concept but separate in implementation, we may also provide
		the ability to view <strong>SRA</strong> objects as
		<strong>fastq</strong> as well as <strong>SAM</strong>. These present
		some level of difficulty that may outweigh their benefit, so they are
		only speculative.
